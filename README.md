# Automated EDA Tool

This Capstone Project involves building an Automated EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) tool that can pre-process and visualize data based on column types using Python. The tool aims to simplify the EDA process by automating the pre-processing steps and providing a comprehensive visualization dashboard for each column type.

## Features

*   Accepts data in various formats, including CSV, Excel, and SQL databases
*   Identifies data types of each column and performs appropriate pre-processing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical features, and more
*   Provides options for feature selection 
*   Generates a comprehensive visualization dashboard for each column type, including histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and more
*   Uses Python's Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly libraries to create interactive data visualizations

## Getting Started

To use this tool, you need to have Python 3.6+ installed on your machine. You can run the following command to install the required packages:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Once the packages are installed, you can run the tool using the following command:

    python eda_tool.py --input-file <path-to-input-file>

Replace `<path-to-input-file>` with the path to your input file in CSV, Excel, or SQL format.
